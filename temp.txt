To whom it may concern:
I am writing on behalf of Anthony Chan, who is applying for a pistol license. 
I have been Anthony's friend for 5 years, having met through mutually shared extracurricular activities (wushu/chinese martial arts, ballroom dance, and now zouk dancing) while Anthony was a student at Columbia. 
I can and attest to his good character.
Anthony Chan is an American citizen and has lived in New York for the last ___ years. 
He has never been arrested, nor has he ever abused drugs or alcohol. 
Anthony is very conscientious and safety-minded. 
Anthony is aware of the risks and moral obligations of handling firearms and has prepared accordingly. 
I know that he is already familiar with firearms from his past experience in the Navy. 
He has already (taken safety course, installed a lock, etc) to prepare for this new responsibility. 
I trust him to handle a gun with greater care of maturity.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Please leave a voicemail if calling so I know who is calling and can return the call. I'm generally available to pick up a call.

Sincerely,
Vangie Shue

To Whom It May Concern: 

Anthony Chan has asked that I provide this character reference letter for him. I understand that this letter will be part of his application for a pistol permit. 

I have been Anthony's friend for over 5 years and can confidently attest to his clean record and outstanding character. In that time, we have shared mutual hobbies such as wushu/chinese martial arts, ballroom dance, and now zouk dancing, starting while Anthony was a student at Columbia University. 

I have always known Anthony to be a level headed individual and I would have no problem with his obtaining a firearm license. He has never been arrested, nor has he ever abused drugs or alcohol. 
He has demonstrated the ability to make good decisions and I have no doubt he will make the correct decisions as to the responsible handling and care of owning a firearm. 

If you have any additional questions, or if there is anything specific that you require of me, please do not hesitate to contact me at (phone number) 

Sincerely, 
Vangie Shue
