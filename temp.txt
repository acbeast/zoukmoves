To whom it may concern:
I am writing on behalf of Anthony Chan, who is applying for a pistol license. 
I have been Anthony's friend for 5 years, having met through mutually shared extracurricular activities (wushu/chinese martial arts, ballroom dance, and now zouk dancing) while Anthony was a student at Columbia. 
I can and attest to his good character.
Anthony Chan is an American citizen and has lived in New York for the last ___ years. 
He has never been arrested, nor has he ever abused drugs or alcohol. 
Anthony is very conscientious and safety-minded. 
Anthony is aware of the risks and moral obligations of handling firearms and has prepared accordingly. 
I know that he is already familiar with firearms from his past experience in the Navy. 
He has already (taken safety course, installed a lock, etc) to prepare for this new responsibility. 
I trust him to handle a gun with greater care of maturity.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Please leave a voicemail if calling so I know who is calling and can return the call. I'm generally available to pick up a call.

Sincerely,
Vangie Shue
